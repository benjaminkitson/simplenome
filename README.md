An extremely simple, lightweight metronome web app. Metronomes are often bloated with ads and subjectively unnecessary features, so I made one (more like trying to make one) that isn't.

This is my first attempt building anything entirely from scratch, and is more about practicing HTML, JS, CSS and Git as it is about producing the world's greatest metronome, so there'll surely be some strangeness in the code and git history - got to learn somehow!

It can be found at www.simplenome.com - at present, it doesn't seem to work in mobile browsers, and doesn't work terribly well in desktop Safari either. It also currently uses setTimeout(), so isn't hugely accurate - I'm hoping to update it to use scheduling and the Web Audio API in future.

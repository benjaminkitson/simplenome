An extremely simple, lightweight metronome web app. Metronomes are often bloated with ads and subjectively unnecessary features, so I made one that isn't.

It can be found at www.simplenome.com - at present, it doesn't seem to work in mobile browsers, and doesn't work terribly well in desktop Safari either. It also currently uses setTimeout(), so isn't hugely accurate - I'm hoping to update it to use scheduling and the Web Audio API in future.
